## Development

- install `poetry` via `pipx`
- activate the virtual environment managed by poetry via `poetry shell`
  Note that on some environments this command may cause collissions with
  configured keyboard shortcuts.  If there are problems, you can source
  the environment variables from the autogenerated venv with:
  `source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate`
- install dependencies into the activated environment with `poetry install`
- run the example via `python cmd/fhttp/main.py`
- deactivate the virtual environment with `exit`
